				<p>Water damage is one of the most costly and frustrating problems a property owner can face ‚Äî but it‚Äôs also one of the most preventable. At Sirgee Construction Company, we offer expert waterproofing solutions to keep moisture out, protect your foundation, and preserve the value of your property.

					From interior basement sealing to full exterior foundation protection, we use proven techniques and quality materials to keep water exactly where it belongs ‚Äî outside.

				<!-- <p>We understand the importance of protecting your home or business from the hazards of asbestos. We offer a wide range of asbestos-related services to help you identify, assess, and safely remove asbestos from your property. Our services include: -->
				<ul>
					<li><strong>üè† Basement Waterproofing: </strong> We seal basements from the inside and out, stopping leaks, dampness, and musty odors before they become serious issues. Our process includes wall crack repairs, waterproof coatings, vapor barriers, and drainage solutions that redirect water away from your home‚Äôs foundation.</li>
					<li><strong>üß± Exterior Foundation Waterproofing
: </strong> For long-term protection, we offer full exterior waterproofing by excavating around your foundation, applying a waterproof membrane, and installing proper drainage systems like French drains. This creates a permanent barrier between your foundation walls and surrounding soil moisture.

</li>
					<li><strong>üï≥Ô∏è Crack & Joint Sealing
: </strong>
Water often finds its way through the smallest gaps. We professionally seal foundation cracks, expansion joints, and pipe penetrations using high-grade sealants that stay flexible and resist aging, ensuring no leaks or seepage over time.

</li>
					<li><strong>üí¶ Sump Pump Systems & Drainage: </strong>To keep your basement dry, we install and maintain sump pump systems, interior French drains, and weeping tile systems that move water safely away from your structure ‚Äî especially during heavy rain or snowmelt.</li>
				<li><strong>üåßÔ∏è Crawl Space Encapsulation: </strong>Damp crawl spaces can lead to mold, mildew, and poor air quality. We fully encapsulate crawl spaces with heavy-duty vapor barriers, insulation, and drainage to create a dry, clean, and energy-efficient space beneath your home.</li>
				</ul>
